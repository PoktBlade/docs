# Getting Started

Before getting started here is a list of things this guide will **NOT** cover:

- Buying/Selling POKT
- Buying a domain name
- Setting up a DNS record
- Security and privacy
- Node setup for other blockchains
- Estimating profits/losses from running Pocket nodes

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- A domain name
- The ability to add DNS records for your domain
- 15,100 POKT (if you want to stake your node)

:::tip

You can walk-through this guide and setup a Pocket node without having to purchase POKT or stake anything. However, Pocket nodes will only earn rewards if they are staked.

:::

If you don't have a domain name you can register one from a DNS registrar like [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). Namecheap and most other registrars will allow you to add DNS records for your domain. But you can also use another DNS provider like [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Again, this guide will not be going into the specifics of how to set up a DNS record. So, if you're not familiar with setting up DNS records, you'll need to consult your DNS provider's documentation.
