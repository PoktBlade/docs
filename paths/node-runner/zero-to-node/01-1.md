To run a node you'll need is a server (a computer) that is always connected to the Internet. The server could be hosted anywhere as long as it has a good internet connection and a static IP address. So your Pocket node could even be run at your home if you choose. However, for this guide, we'll be using a virtual machine on the [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) cloud service.

:::note

Linode is just one of many cloud hosting providers. This guide has no affiliation with Linode and does not recommend any one provider over another. The general steps outlined here should work for most cloud providers. If you're using a different provider, you can [skip ahead past the server setup process](04-1).

:::

We'll be using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) for the operating system. Technically, you can run a Pocket node on other Linux distributions, on a Mac, and probably on Windows. However, most of the documentation and support you'll find will be for Ubuntu. So, unless you're very experienced and looking for a challenge - you should stick with Ubuntu. Also, a later Ubuntu version should also work, but 20.04 is the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version with an end of life (EOL) date of April 30, 2030. So it's probably the best choice at this point.

Now let's start by creating a Linode instance (a virtual machine).

## Creating a Linode instance

To create a Linode instance, do the following:

1. Get a [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) account and login.
2. Create a new Linode with the following specifications:
    - **Image / Distribution**: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
    - **Region**: `Atlanta, GA`
    - **Linode Plan**: `Dedicated 8 GB - 4 CPU, 160 GB Storage, 8 GB RAM`
    - **Root Password**: `sOm3_hArD-p4ssw0rd!`
    - **Linode Label**: `pokt001`
3. Wait for the Linode to be created and show up as running in the web interface.

:::tip

For a more detailed guide on setting up a Linode instance, see the [Linode docs](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/getting-started/). Also, note that the `Atlanta, GA` region was selected for this guide because it supports [NVMe storage](https://www.linode.com/products/block-storage/#nvme-block-storage) which is preferable for running nodes. Most other regions also support NVMe storage but [check here to make sure](https://www.linode.com/blog/cloud-storage/nvme-block-storage-global-rollout/).

Now that the Linode instance is created and running, we'll need to add some additional storage using a Linode volume.
