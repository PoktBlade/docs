Before testing, we'll need to create an account and then set it to the validator address.

## Creating an account

To create an account, you can run the following command:

```bash
pocket accounts create
```

:::tip

Rather than creating a new account, you could also import an existing account. For details on importing an account, see the [Pocket CLI docs](https://docs.pokt.network/core/specs/cli/accounts#import-an-account).

:::


## Listing accounts

```bash
pocket accounts list
```

## Setting the validator address

```bash
pocket accounts set-validator $VALIDATOR_ADDRESS
```

## Confirm the validator address

```bash
 pocket accounts get-validator
```
