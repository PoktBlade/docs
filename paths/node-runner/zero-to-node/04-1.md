The [Uncomplicated Firewall](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall) (UFW) is a security tool that helps you protect your server from attacks. It provides an easy way to manage ports and services that you want to make available while keeping unnecessary ports disabled.

## Ports you need to open

For running a Pocket node, you'll need to open the following ports:

- `80`: HTTP
- `443`: HTTPS
- `8081`: For the Pocket HTTP API
- `26656`: For the Pocket RPC API
- `22`: SSH

## Enabling UFW

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```
> Note: Type `y` to confirm.

## Default to deny all
```bash
sudo ufw default deny
```

## Allow SSH
```bash
sudo ufw allow ssh
```

## Allow nginx (80, 443)
```bash
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
```

## Allow port 8081
```bash
sudo ufw allow 8081
```
## Allow port 26656
```bash
sudo ufw allow 26656
```
## Confirm ufw status
That's it for the ufw setup. Let's just check the ufw status to confirm the ports are open. To do that, run the following command:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```
