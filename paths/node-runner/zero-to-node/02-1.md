At this point you should be logged in via SSH to a server running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, as the `pocket` user that we setup in the previous step. 

Before we install the Pocket software, there are a few dependencies we'll need to add. But before we install anything, we'll update the existing packages first.

## Updating system packages

1. Update the repository index with the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
2. Update the distribution with the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo apt dist-upgrade -y
    ```

After the update completes, we're ready to install the dependencies.

## Installing dependencies

There are a handful of dependencies but installing them won't take long. Also, some might already be installed. So if one of the dependencies exists, just move on the the next one.

### git

```bash
sudo apt-get install git -y
```
### build tools
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential -y
```
<!-- ### procps
```bash
apt-get install procps -y
``` -->

### curl
```bash
sudo apt-get install curl -y
```
### file
```bash
sudo apt-get install file -y
```
### nginx
```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
```
### certbot
```bash
sudo apt install certbot -y
```
### python3-certbot-nginx
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-certbot-nginx -y
```

After installing the previous dependencies, there is one more dependency we'll need to add - that's Go, we'll do that next.
